Inner Join
-----------
Inner Join is nothing but Mathematical set Intersection operation.
This joins brings the records from all the tables's columns from all the table used to join by default.
The inner join performed on multiple tables is AND operation.

Eg:

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments
  has_many :likes
  has_many :shares
end

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
end
class Like < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
end
class Share < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
end

Rails Inner Join for above
---------------------------
Post.joins(:comments, :likes, :shares)


SQL Inner join for above
-------------------------
SELECT * FROM posts
INNER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
INNER JOIN likes ON likes.post_id = posts.id
INNER JOIN shares ON shares.post_id = posts.id;

Important notes:
Posts with comments, likes and shares only will be retried
Posts with absence of atleast one of comments, likes or shares won't be retrieved
